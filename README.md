### A file format for simplified music notation exchange.

#### Purpose

A great number of text-based languages for encoding music notation have been created.  MusicXML is the most ubiquitous.  Some of the others are Guido, MuseData, Humdrum, MEI, and the forthcoming MNX.  Many of these are specified with a great deal of flexibility.  The flexibility afforded by these languages produces, as a side-effect, a large implementation surface.To describe the choices faced in creating a music notation encoding format, the MNX team described a triangle, similar to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle](project management triangle)  The MNX team substituted "semantics, interoperability, generality" for “fast, cheap, good” and suggested that the community could pick two, but not three of these.Obbligato would like to propose a triangle slightly altered from that of MNX, “expressiveness/generality, interoperability, ease-of-implementation”.` ^
